When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I use github from not my computer, or if I ask someone to make contributions to my github repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to keep control of what to pull and when, for example if there are other contributors as well making changes to my remote.
