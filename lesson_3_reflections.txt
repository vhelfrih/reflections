When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I use github from not my computer, or if I ask someone to make contributions to my github repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to keep control of what to pull and when, for example if there are other contributors as well making changes to my remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repositories on Github, clones are the exact copies of repositories, branches are the different ways of a changing repository. I would use forks on Github and clones on my local computer in order not to make changes to an original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is useful to be always up-to-date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be very frustrating to review changes without GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If I work together with others on a special issue, I would rather have more control over what to merge into my local master.
